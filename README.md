# Cake maker
This is my final project at Technigo's bootcamp. It is a webshop where you can order a cake. You choose the ingredients of the cake and place your order. You have to sign up to order. There is also a page where you can see the latest orders. 

## How it is made
The ingredients you can choose from, the users and the orders are all saved in a MongoDB database using Express APIs. The frontend is built with React and Redux and styled using styled components.
